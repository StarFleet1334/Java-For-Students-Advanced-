A text block is a String object and as a result, shares the same
properties as String objects (immutable and interned).

• you can call String methods on a text block.
• A text block begins with three double-quote characters
followed by newline i.e. """

• text blocks cannot be put on one line
• the text of a text block cannot foll """


Example:
    String tbName = """
                Sean Kennedy""";
