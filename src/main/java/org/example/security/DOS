 -> A denial of service attack is where one or more requests are made with the purpose of
    disrupting services.

 -> This can be accomplished in a number of ways:
    - leaking resources - always use try-with-resources to ensure you do not leak resources
    - working with extremely large files - check the file size.
    - inclusion attacks - where a file contains several other files e.g. "zip bomb".
