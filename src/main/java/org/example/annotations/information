-> As stated earlier, annotations have a lot in common with interfaces;
   for example, a marker annotation has no elements
   (a marker interface has no methods). Annotations,as with interfaces, can be applied to
   unrelated classes.

-> In fact, we annotate out annotation with @interface.
    - public @interface MyAnnotation {} // marker annotation


-> An annotation element is an attribute of the annotation. The elements (attributes)
can have values.

Example:
    public @interface MyAnnotation {
        int myElement(); // looks like an abstract method!
    }

-> Remember that annotation have their origins in interfaces.
    Essentially, the JVM translates the above element into an interface method and
    the annotation itself as an implementation of the interface
