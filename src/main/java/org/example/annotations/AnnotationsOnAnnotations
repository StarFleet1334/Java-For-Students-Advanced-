-> There are annotations that can be applied to annotations.

-> As opposed to applying built-in annotations to types
    (methods,interfaces,fields etc..); we can actually apply built-in annotations
    to annotations themselves.


-> For example, you might want to limit where your annotation can be used or you
may want your annotation information included in Javadoc documentation


                            @Target

 -> limits the types that the annotation can be applied to.
 -> The types are specified as an array of ElementType enum values
