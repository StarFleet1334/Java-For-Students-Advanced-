-> MetaData is information about information

-> Annotations, via metadata, enable us to add value to our code.

-> We can annotate (assign metadata) to classes,methods,variables etc...

-> Though optional, when used they must be used correctly.

-> Annotations operate much like interfaces. In fact, their origins are interfaces.
Their "elements" look like abstract methods. This will be clearer when we look at examples.

-> Annotation names are case sensitive; however it is common to practice to start the name
with an uppercase letter.

Example:
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "....";
    }

-> Like interfaces, annotations can be applied to unrelated class
