Private interface methods:

-> Introduced in Java 9, interfaces can now have private methods.
-> This private methods can be both static and non-static
-> As they are private, they are accessible withing the interface only.
-> As with classes, you cannot access a non-static interface method from a static method.

They have two advantages:
1. reduce code duplication
2. improve code encapsulation.
