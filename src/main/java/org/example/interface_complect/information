------ 13 Rules about Interfaces in Java

1. Fields in an interface are public,static and final implicitly.

2. Methods in an interface are public implicitly

3. A class can implement multiple interfaces.

4. The Overriding methods cannot have more restrict access specifiers
    (because methods in interface are public implicitly.)

5. Non-abstract classes must override all methods declared in the super interfaces.

6. Abstract classes are not forced to override all methods from their super interfaces.
The first concrete class in the inheritance tree must override all methods

7. An Interface cannot extend another class

8. An Interface can extend from multiple interfaces

9. An interface can be nested within a class

10. An interface can be nested within another interface.

11. Methods in an interface cannot be static and final

12. Since Java 8, an interface can have default methods and static methods.

13. Functional interface is an interface that has only one method.
