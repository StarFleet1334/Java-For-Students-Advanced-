-> Java is a strongly-typed language; you must specify tye type of a variable when introducing it.

-> However, since Java 10, we have the option, in certain scenario, of using the keyword var
instead of the type. In these situations, the compiler infers the type var x = "abc" as x is a String

-> Remember that the variables must be local and must be initialised on the line where they are declared.
