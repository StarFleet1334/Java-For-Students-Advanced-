Both PreparedStatement and CallableStatement are sub interfaces of Statement.
We will talk about CallableStatement later; for the moment we will focus on PreparedStatement;

A PreparedStatement enables us to execute SQL statements

-> Use the Connection object to get a PreparedStatement.
Once we have the PreparedStatement we can now run the SQL.

Type type of SQL statement determines the way you run it.


-> SELECT
    - ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();

-> INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE
    int rowsAffected = ps.executeUpdate()
