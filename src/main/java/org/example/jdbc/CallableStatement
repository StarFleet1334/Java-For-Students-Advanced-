Rather than have your SQL (as a PreparedStatement) in your Java code which must be
sent across the network; we can have our SQL stored on the database in a "stored procedure".

SQL can be stored in the database as stored procedures. This reduces network traffic.

We use CallableStatement's when we working with stored procedures.

We do not need to be able to read/write stored procedures but we must know how to call/execute them.

In addition to having no parameters, a stored procedure can specify the following parameters:
    -> IN - an input parameter
    -> OUT - an output parameter
    -> INOUT - a parameter that serves for both input and output
