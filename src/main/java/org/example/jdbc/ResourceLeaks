Database resources are expensive to create so make sure you close them when finished.

try-with-resources is very helpful here as it automatically closes resources for us.

The order is important:
1. ResultSet
2. PreparedStatement or CallabelStatement
3. Connection

-> try-with-resources closes resources automatically, in the reverse order from which they were initialized
